This program has 3 functions which are calculator, encoder and decoder.

1.Calculator

-It is a regular calculator with 24 operations.

2.Encoder

-It takes a message from the user and then converts each letter of the message to numbers according to a reference list which are (1)ASCII and (2)Phone Button 
and applies the user-selected calculator operations to all letters individually. 

-Reference list number, operation number(s) and a special number form the key respectively. 
Key example; 110561236 > 1(reference) - 10 - 5 - 6 - 1 - 2(operation numbers) - 36(special number) 

-Finally, We get an encoded message and a key.

3.Decoder

-It takes an encoded message(numbers) and its key to give the real message(letters).
